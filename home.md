Greetings! 

I am a Boya Postdoctoral Fellow at the [School of International Studies, Peking University](https://www.sis.pku.edu.cn/en/). At PKU, I primarily work with [Xun Pang](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/xun_pang/home) on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of social science and artificial intelligence, and I serve as Assistant Director of the [PKU Analytics Lab for Global Risk Politics](https://riskalab.pku.edu.cn/en/).

I obtained my PhD in political science from [the Department of International Relations, Tsinghua University](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/iren/) and was a visiting PhD student in the [Department of Political Science at Columbia University](https://polisci.columbia.edu/) from September 2022 to October 2023. During my time at Columbia, I was advised by [Junyan Jiang](https://www.junyanjiang.com/) and [Naoki Egami](https://naokiegami.com/index.html). I also hold an M.A. from [Johns Hopkins SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/), an M.L. from [Tsinghua university](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/iren/), and a BA from the [University of International Business and Economics](https://english.uibe.edu.cn/). Prior to pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked at [CITIC Securites Asset Management](https://www.cs.ecitic.com/newsite/en/companyWebsite/assetManagement/). 

My research spans global governance, elite politics, and Chinese politics, with a broader interest in applying AI-driven and multimodal methods to questions in the social sciences. My work has been published on <em>American Political Science Review</em>, <em>International Affairs</em>, among others.

“每个人都会经历这个阶段，看见一座山，就想知道山后面是什么。
我很想告诉他，可能翻过山后面，你会发觉没有什么特别。回头看会觉得这边更好。
但是他不会相信 —— 
以他的性格，自己不试过又怎会甘心？”
